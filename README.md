# Experiments for paper Revisiting the GreCon Algorithm for Boolean Matrix Factorization

The repository contains an implementation of all experiments that presented in the paper submitted to Knowledge and Information Systems. Implementation of the GreCon2 algorithm can be found on [https://github.com/rvyjidacek/FcaKit/blob/master/Sources/FcaKit/BMF/GreCon2.swift](https://github.com/rvyjidacek/FcaKit/blob/master/Sources/FcaKit/BMF/GreCon2.swift)

## Requirements

1. Swift version 5.3 or higher
2. Python version 3.8 or higher
3. Operating system: Linux or macOS

## Usage

First, you have to clone this repository to your computer:

```

    git clone git@github.com:rvyjidacek/Revisiting-the-GreCon-Algorithm-for-Boolean-Matrix-Factorization.git

```

Then run the bash script run.sh


```

    sh run.sh datasets
    
```
The script executes a time benchmark and plots the graphs that can be found in the paper.
